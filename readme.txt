== Description ==
Flowplayer/WordPress plugin is an extremely simple tool to embed videos and (with an [Enterprise plan](https://flowplayer.com/pricing)) livstreams from the [Flowplayer platform](https://flowplayer.com/features) on your WP site. The videos are embedded directly on your pages without leaving Wordpress and without writing any HTML code. The plugin works seamlessly with both Gutenberg and the classic editor.

Your videos are played with the best possible quality and speed regardless of the end-user device and the quality is automatically switched when the connection speed changes. The player design is highly customizable and minimalistic so that the video is the start of the show — not the player.

If your Flowplayer subscription covers ads support (available in Professional and Enterprise plans), you can embed a player with ads configured.
